	FAREWELL SPEECH <br>




The greater the glimmer, the grimier its secrets are. Now, this quote is not a universally applicable axiom. But, I said it here to implicitly say something that I believe some of you have already comprehended by now. If not, then, try harder. I’ll let you draw your own deductions. This day marks the end of 15 years of schooling. Today, we are, I suppose, inundated with eclectic and ambiguous emotions. To those who believe that you have attained freedom finally, I regret to inform you that you are slightly wrong. You can’t unfortunately be completely untethered in this dystopia. Usually, during farewell speeches, the quote ‘It is not the destination that matters but the journey’ is used infuriatingly frequently. It is true nonetheless. But reiterating a string of astutely articulated words won’t change the fact that many don’t care. In an appalling number of institutions, families and societal circles, the destinations that we have gone to define our worth. I believe that destinations are put there so that people may complete their journey and begin a new one. It is the impetus that pushes us. They are the nonexistent lights at the end of all our tunnels that grow farther as we grow closer. To fixate over a destination and to base your self-worth is an egregious crime that even I am guilty of committing.

Our batch is different from all the other batches in the sense that we spent the two most allegedly claimed important years of our life being tutored online. That like everything in the world is dichotomous. I reckon you all know what the benefits of this form of pedagogy. But, the defects of and the predicaments encountered due to this system are innummerable. Our batch experienced countless catastrophes. This brings me to the point where I am going to push my luck by addressing a tragedy that we have conveniently refused to even acknowledge. Again, I fatefully shall address it surreptitiously since I too am afraid of possible ramifications. We lost someone. But, absurdly, none of us talked about it. We simply moved on. No… to put it frankly, we scampered off. We pretended it never happened. Why? That is a question whose answer I wish not to say. The more I think of it, the more absurd it becomes. But, I am not here to castigate. Admonishment is now fatuous and those that I seek to berate have the power to uproot me in the blink of an eye. But, I’d like to tell you all one thing, life is gestalt in nature. Though it is conventional of society to evaluate us based on our laurels and achievements, keep in mind that life, though comprised of events, bonds, achievements, losses, smiles, tears, worries and tranquility, it is greater than the mere summation of the aforementioned things. So, when the urge to take the leap intensifies, find something to latch on to. An unexplained miracle must not be shunned for reasons that seem deluging at first. Unlike agathists, I am not requesting you all to look towards the bright side because there are and will be certain days when bright sides won’t be enough to keep you afloat. There will be melancholy strong enough to blind your eyes, there will be insurmountable pressure that can’t be relieved merely through words and there will be nights when your troubles keep you awake. These events are imminent and we all go through it. Don’t be deceived by the masks that we have chosen to wear. You are not the only one. We all are. We masquerade joy when society deems its time to jubilate and mourn when people decide it is time to shed tears. We are all concurrently persistent and weak. Life if not absolute. Labels can’t define us completely. Our deeds can’t determine the way we end up. Take me for example. My marks were quite promising till 8th and now I can count my scores with my fingers. It is but a folly of humans to let the emotional situation at a specific moment in life determine the entire course of their life. No emotion, no person, no institution must have colossal effects upon our lives.  So, when you feel verklempt, unleash a prehensile grip on whatever it is that can save your life. Don’t try to find reasons not to die, find reasons to live and do it gradually.


I find it funny how inconveniences draw people together. I joined the hostel on July 7th 2018. From that very day, I have seen how the assaults on our privacy and nonsencial norms have reinforced the bonds between hostelers. There are flowers that flourish in the winter and perish when it is sunny. Akin to that, the bonds formed at the hostel remain so due to the treatments meted out to us. 3 years later, in 2021, when I returned to the hostel, I met two people who would change my life forever. A stupendous shutterbug who’d capture fleeting moments with mind blowing perfection and a perseverant chap who knew how to put me back to pieces everytime I broke myself due to my insouciance. It wasn’t just their qualities that drew me to them and them to be, but also the storms that we together weathered. We battled through cholestrol-inducing puris, chappatis as dry as my romantic life, green peas curry as nauseating as Omar Lulu movies and uncooked Appams as sticky as … well… I guess I’ll stop it here. Our common anger against such inadequacies made us more stronger than ever. Now, when we return back to the comfort of our homes, we won’t have a shiny round head to make our camaraderie more tenacious.  I am not ranting but stating out how adverse conditions can have positive unintended effects. Now before I move on to my next monotonous topic, I’d like to thank Father Jose Puzhakkara. Though I find  many of his rules to be preposterous in nature, what I have towards him his respect. It takes a lot of courage, talent and determination to run a hostel where there are people like me. Though his short-temper, voluminous vocabulary, supreme stealth and terrible rage have earned him the nick-name odiyan, he still hasn’t let such shenanigans upend him. That is commendable to say the least. 

Moving on, I’d like to tell people of etterath. Have you ever ended up feeling hollow after watching an entire series? Well, that feeling of emptiness is called Etterath. Many of us shall end up being victims of Etterath once 12th grade reaches its much awaited culmination. Ever since I became a student, all I wanted to do was complete 12th , get into a good college, get a good job and then eat to my stomach’s content. Unfortunately life isn’t that easy and can’t be lived merely by jumping from one destination to the other. I have become quite fond of this journey and am saddened by the fact that this shall end very soon. Though I have had to encounter days of shame, I still recall all those days not with resentment but with endearment. Khalil Gibran once said “How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city.”… similarly, I shall not leave this place with only contentment but also with sadness. Though my idealogies differ from the ones that this school endorses, I still shall descend the stairs of this school (the one meant for boys...)(Looks at Mr.Sadacharam)  with lesions. I presume that this hollowness much like everything else will make me embrace another change. Paucities and plights are indicators beseeching us to change ourself. Now, before ending this verbiage, I’d like to say something personal. If you keep on facing failure frequently, don’t expend all your peace and energy trying to get it done. Learn how and when to give up. Many people here would argue with that statement of mine but some things are not worth the hardships faced. Etterath is usually accompanied by Klexos which is the art of dwelling on the past.  “IS IT NOT BUT A FOLLY OF MAN TO SEEK REFUGE IN THE PAST? THE ART OF KLEXOS MUST BE RESERVED FOR THE MOST DESPERATE OF ALL EVENTS. TO RUN OFF INTO THE PAST EVERYTIME A MINOR INCONVENIENCE OCCURS IS BUT AN ACT OF NOT ONLY COWARDICE BUT ALSO OF FOOLISHNESS AS WELL. THE PAST MUST NOT DEFINE WHO WE ARE UNLESS WE COMPLETELY, DUE TO SOME REASON, FORGET WHO WE ARE. THE PAST IS THE PAST FOR A REASON. RELIVING IT WILL NOT BRING THE CATHARSIS THAT YOU SEEK. THE PAST HAS HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THIS IS THE VERY REASON THINGS FROM THE PAST DO NOT STRIKE YOU AS THE SAME.” Now, there are many people trying to restore things to their old opulence. To them I say, please do not engage in this act of futility.  These include people of power, literacy and wisdom. Even the strongest of all of us are often seduced by the lustre of the past. Seeking refuge in the past is asinine to say the least. By reliving moments that have already gone by, we are pawning of all possible ways of amelioration and forfeting the present. There are certain schools that engage in this foible. Some find the way we think and react to be...abnormal. The increasing need to go back to a normal that existed only in the past is, I must say, disconcerting. Imposing laws and norms that were lauded in the past won’t make the present the past. I think it is safe to surmise that the person to whom I intended this message has received it. With this unproved faith, I end my odious monologue. 

Before the much desired culmination, I seek to show my gratefulness to my benefactors and well-wishers. I’d like to thank the inmates of room B3. Had it not been for them, thIs speech wouldn’t have even been conceived in this head of mine. Now you know whom to be angry at. If you do plan on attacking them, I must warn you that Devajith, our adorable one-punch man, will give you a tough time. He can’t be defeated easily.  Siddhu and Siddhu, thanks for your valuable input. I extend my humble gratitude to the rest of you...for doing nothing….I mean, for showing the longanimity to listen to this speech and I use this opportunity to simultaneously apologise to agathists and optimists alike. My nihilistic views, I believe, have incurred your chagrin and disappointment. If so, I implore you to find it in your hearts to forgive this nescient moron.
